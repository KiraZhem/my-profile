 		  I am convinced that human life is filled with many pure, happy, serene examples of insincerity, truly splendid of their kind-of people deceiving one another without (strangely enough) any wounds being inflicted, of people who seem unaware even that they are deceiving one another.

 	       <h2>The Setting Sun</h2>
 	        <p>
 		     The narrator is Kazuko, a young woman born to gentility but now impoverished. Though she wears Western clothes, her outlook is Japanese; her life is static, and she recognizes that she is spiritually empty. In the course of the novel she survives the deaths of her aristocratic mother and her sensitive drug-addicted brother Naoji, an intellectual ravaged by his own and by societyâ€™s spiritual failures. She also spends a sad, sordid night with the dissipated writer Uehara, and with him she conceives a child in the hope that it will be the first step in a moral revolution.
